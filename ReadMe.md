# Assignment 1

## First Milestone

start from 21.03.2022

In the first milestone I have learned various new things.
Firstly, I learned about the data types in Swift and how to use them in a program, how to write functions, closures and loops and how the Sift playground helps to test out any code. After we looked into how to create terminal and iOS projects in Swift and how to use the Xcode IDE.

We then continued with SwiftUI, which is a framework for building user interfaces in Swift. We learned how to create a view, talked about different view types like H-Stack, V-Stack, Z-Stack, ListView, Navigation View, how to extract views and about a common structure division in Master and Detail view.
Seperation of concerns is a very important topic in SwiftUI, which means that the view should only contain the view code and the logic should be in the ViewModel. The ViewModel can be a class or struct that is responsible for the logic of the view.

I've implemented the following tasks:

- a navigationview with a list of tasks
- a static checklist with 5 items, each item has a text, a checked state and a categoryId
- a static category list with 3 categories, each category has a name and a color
- a view that displays a list with the tasks, each task is displayed with its category color, text and checked state

Other topics that were covered but not implemented in the first milestone are:

- Navigation
- Inputs
- Master and Detail View
- State
- Binding
